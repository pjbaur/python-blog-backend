## API Error Handling

This API follows standard HTTP status codes and provides consistent error response formats to help clients handle errors appropriately.

### Error Response Format

All error responses follow this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "detail": "Human-readable error message",
  "errors": ["Optional array of specific validation errors or additional details"]
}
```

- The `detail` field is always present and contains a human-readable error message.
- The `errors` field is optional and may contain additional error details, such as validation errors.

### HTTP Status Codes

The API uses the following standard HTTP status codes:

| Status Code | Meaning               | Common Scenarios                                         |
|-------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **2xx**     | **Success**           |                                                          |
| 200         | OK                    | Successful GET, PUT, or POST when no resource is created |
| 201         | Created               | Successful resource creation via POST                    |
| 204         | No Content            | Successful DELETE                                        |
| **4xx**     | **Client Errors**     |                                                          |
| 400         | Bad Request           | Invalid request parameters or body                       |
| 401         | Unauthorized          | Missing or invalid authentication token                  |
| 403         | Forbidden             | Valid authentication but insufficient permissions        |
| 404         | Not Found             | Resource not found                                       |
| 409         | Conflict              | Resource already exists or state conflict                |
| 422         | Unprocessable Entity  | Validation failure (e.g., password requirements)         |
| **5xx**     | **Server Errors**     |                                                          |
| 500         | Internal Server Error | Unexpected server-side error                             |
| 503         | Service Unavailable   | Server temporarily unavailable                           |

### Common Error Scenarios

#### Authentication Errors

```json
// 401 Unauthorized - Missing or invalid token
{
  "detail": "Not authenticated"
}

// 401 Unauthorized - Invalid credentials during login
{
  "detail": "Incorrect email or password"
}

// 403 Forbidden - Insufficient permissions
{
  "detail": "Not authorized"
}
```

#### Resource Errors

```json
// 404 Not Found - Resource doesn't exist
{
  "detail": "Post not found"
}

// 403 Forbidden - Operation not allowed on resource
{
  "detail": "You can only update your own posts"
}
```

#### Validation Errors

```json
// 422 Unprocessable Entity - Password validation failed
{
  "detail": "Password validation failed",
  "errors": [
    "Password too short (minimum 8 characters)",
    "Password too common"
  ]
}

// 400 Bad Request - Email already in use
{
  "detail": "Email already registered"
}
```

#### Server Errors

```json
// 500 Internal Server Error
{
  "detail": "An unexpected error occurred"
}
```

### Error Handling for Clients

Clients should:

1. Always check for non-200 status codes
2. Parse the `detail` field for a human-readable error message
3. Check for an optional `errors` array for additional validation details
4. Implement appropriate retry logic for 5xx errors
5. Never retry on 4xx errors without fixing the request

### Validation Errors

For endpoints that require data validation, failed validations return a 422 status code with specific validation error messages. This is especially important for complex validations like password strength requirements.

### Error Logging

All errors are logged server-side with appropriate context and severity levels. Error logs include timestamps, request paths, error details, and when relevant, user identifiers for troubleshooting while maintaining privacy.

### Internationalization

Error messages are currently provided in English only. Future API versions may support localized error messages through Accept-Language headers.

## Trade-offs

### Business Logic in Routes vs. Service Layer

This application places business logic directly within route handlers rather than using a dedicated service layer. This architectural decision has several implications:

#### Advantages
- **Simplicity**: For smaller applications, keeping logic in routes is straightforward
- **Development Speed**: Faster initial development due to less abstraction
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Fewer files and less code organization needed
- **Easier to Understand**: New developers can see the full request-to-response flow in one place

#### Disadvantages
- **Reduced Testability**: Business logic mixed with HTTP concerns is harder to unit test
- **Code Duplication**: Similar business logic may be repeated across multiple route handlers
- **Maintainability Issues**: As the application grows, route files become bloated
- **Harder Refactoring**: Changing business rules requires touching HTTP-specific code

For a portfolio project like this one, this approach is acceptable, but for larger production applications, refactoring toward a service-oriented architecture would be beneficial for maintainability and testability.

### MongoDB vs SQL Database

This application uses MongoDB (NoSQL) instead of a relational database like PostgreSQL.

#### Advantages
- **Schema Flexibility**: Easy to evolve data models without migrations
- **JSON-Native Storage**: Natural fit for JSON-based APIs
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Easier sharding and distribution for high-volume data
- **Performance**: Fast reads and writes for document-centric operations

#### Disadvantages
- **Lack of ACID Transactions**: Limited transaction support compared to SQL databases
- **Denormalization**: May require duplicating data across documents
- **Query Complexity**: Complex joins and relationships are more difficult
- **Storage Efficiency**: Can be less space-efficient than normalized SQL data

The choice of MongoDB works well for a blog platform where document structure (posts, comments) naturally fits the document model, but a relational database might be better for highly relational data with complex joins.

### JWT Authentication Strategy

The application uses JWT tokens with refresh token functionality for authentication.

#### Advantages
- **Stateless Authentication**: No need to store session data server-side
- **Scalability**: Works well across distributed systems
- **Cross-Domain**: Easily used across different domains and services
- **Mobile Friendly**: Well-suited for mobile and API authentication

#### Disadvantages
- **Token Size**: JWTs can be larger than session IDs
- **Revocation Challenges**: Tokens remain valid until expiration unless additional invalidation measures are implemented
- **Secret Management**: Requires secure handling of signing keys
- **Token Storage**: Client-side storage requires careful security considerations

This authentication approach aligns well with the stateless nature of REST APIs, but session-based authentication might be simpler for smaller, monolithic applications.

### Monolithic Application vs Microservices

The application follows a monolithic architecture with modular components rather than microservices.

#### Advantages
- **Simplicity**: Easier development, deployment, and debugging
- **Performance**: No inter-service communication overhead
- **Consistency**: Shared code and models across the application
- **Development Speed**: Faster initial development and iteration

#### Disadvantages
- **Scalability Limitations**: All components must scale together
- **Technology Constraints**: Single technology stack for the entire application
- **Deployment Risk**: Changes to any part require redeploying the entire application
- **Team Coordination**: Can be challenging for larger teams working on different features

For this portfolio application, a monolithic approach provides simplicity and rapid development. Microservices would add unnecessary complexity unless there were specific scalability or team organization requirements.

### FastAPI Framework Choice

Using FastAPI instead of alternatives like Flask, Django, or Express.js.

#### Advantages
- **Performance**: High-speed API serving with Starlette and Uvicorn
- **Type Safety**: Built-in Pydantic data validation
- **OpenAPI Integration**: Automatic API documentation generation
- **Modern Python Features**: Async/await support and type hints

#### Disadvantages
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Newer framework with smaller ecosystem than Django or Flask
- **Learning Curve**: Type annotations and async concepts may be unfamiliar
- **Limited Built-ins**: Fewer built-in features compared to full-stack frameworks like Django
- **Community Size**: Smaller community compared to more established frameworks

FastAPI's focus on API development with modern Python features makes it well-suited for this project, though Django might offer more built-in features and Rails-like development speed for full applications.

### Directory Structure and Code Organization

The application uses a router-based organization pattern.

#### Advantages
- **API-Focused Structure**: Clear organization around API endpoints
- **Separation by Domain**: Easy to find code related to specific features
- **Framework Alignment**: Follows FastAPI's recommended structure
- **Request-Centric**: Navigation correlates to API endpoints

#### Disadvantages
- **Business Logic Scattering**: Business logic can spread across multiple modules
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Features that span multiple domains can be awkward
- **Route Coupling**: Routes may contain mixed concerns (validation, auth, business logic)
- **Growth Challenges**: May become unwieldy as application grows

This structure works well for an API-focused application but alternatives like domain-driven design might better separate business concerns as the application grows.

### Image Storage Strategy

Images can be stored either in the local filesystem or in S3-compatible cloud storage.

#### Advantages of S3 Integration
- **Scalability**: Virtually unlimited storage capacity
- **Reliability**: Built-in redundancy and high availability
- **CDN Integration**: Easy to serve through content delivery networks
- **Security**: Granular access control and encryption options
- **Managed Service**: No need to manage storage infrastructure

#### Disadvantages of S3 Integration
- **Cost**: Additional expenses for storage and bandwidth
- **Complexity**: More configuration required compared to local storage
- **Dependencies**: External service dependency
- **Setup**: Requires S3-compatible service configuration

The application supports both local and S3 storage options, allowing flexibility depending on deployment needs. Local storage works well for development and testing, while S3 is recommended for production deployments. **I was storing images locally. Then I moved them to S3. TODO: It would be nice to configure to either.**

### Error Handling Strategy

The application handles errors through HTTPExceptions and FastAPI's exception handling.

#### Advantages
- **Framework Integration**: Leverages FastAPI's built-in exception handling
- **HTTP Semantics**: Errors map cleanly to HTTP status codes
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward error raising and catching
- **Validation Integration**: Works well with Pydantic validation errors

#### Disadvantages
- **Limited Granularity**: HTTP status codes provide limited error type information
- **Error Consistency**: Error formats may vary across different parts of the application
- **Client Adaptability**: Clients need to handle various error formats
- **Debugging Information**: May include too much or too little information for debugging

This approach provides a good balance for a RESTful API, though more structured error objects with error codes might be beneficial for larger applications.

### Configuration Management

The application uses environment variables for configuration.

#### Advantages
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Easy to configure in different environments
- **Security**: Sensitive values kept out of source code
- **Docker Compatibility**: Works well with containerized deployments
- **Twelve-Factor Alignment**: Follows modern application design principles

#### Disadvantages
- **Type Safety**: Limited type checking for configuration values
- **Documentation**: Configuration options may not be self-documenting
- **Default Values**: Requires additional code for defaults and validation
- **Complex Configurations**: Limited structure for nested configurations

Environment variables provide a simple and effective configuration approach for this application, though structured configuration files might offer better organization for more complex applications.
