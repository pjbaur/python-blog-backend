## 8. **Wireframes or Mockups**
Since no existing designs are available, here are simple wireframe descriptions to visualize data presentation:
- **Home Page**: 
  - List of latest posts with titles and excerpts.
  - Pagination controls at the bottom.
- **Post Page**: 
  - Full post content at the top.
  - Comments section below with a form to add new comments.
- **User Dashboard**: 
  - List of userâ€™s posts with edit/delete buttons.
- **Admin Panel**: 
  - Table of users with an "Inactivate" button for each.

*(Note: Actual wireframes could be created using tools like Figma or Balsamiq.)*

---

## 9. **Glossary of Terms**
- **Post**: An article written by an author.
- **Comment**: Feedback from a user on a post.
- **Author**: A logged-in user who creates posts.
- **Administrator**: A user with privileges to manage the system.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Token for authentication.

---

## 10. **Traceability Matrix**
A traceability matrix links requirements to use cases and test cases. Example:
| **Requirement**                  | **Use Case**      | **Test Case**                              |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Logged-in users can create posts | Create Post       | Verify a logged-in user can create a post |
| Admins can inactivate users      | Manage Users      | Verify an admin can inactivate a user     |

*(The full matrix will be developed during project planning.)*

## 11. **Change Management Plan**
Since this is a personal project:
- **Change Requests**: Tracked via a Kanban board.
- **Review and Approval**: Self-reviewed, focusing on scope maintenance.
- **Impact Analysis**: Assess changes for scope, timeline, and complexity before implementation.

### **Recommendation**
- Document changes in a simple log (e.g., date, change description, impact).
- Prioritize tasks on the Kanban board to avoid overloading.

---

## 12. **Risk Assessment**

### **Identified Risks**
- **Scope Creep**: Adding unplanned features, delaying completion.

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Break tasks into small units (1-2 days of work).
- Use a Kanban board to prioritize and limit work in progress.
- Review scope weekly to stay on track.

## **Summary**
These documents provide a structured foundation for your Blog Application REST API Backend Project. They align with your goal of showcasing skills to potential employers, covering the MVP (user authentication, posts, comments, user management) while noting post-MVP enhancements (e.g., search, analytics). The use of Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Docker is integrated throughout, with clear plans for local hosting and future cloud expansion. Let me know if you need further details or adjustments!
