This questionnaire ensures alignment between your backend API design and the React frontend’s needs. Tailor follow-up questions based on responses to dive deeper into specific areas!

## Will this information be sufficient to hand over to the Software Architect?

The questionnaire you have is a **strong foundation**, but to ensure it’s fully actionable for a Software Architect, you may need to refine it further by addressing **technical depth**, **constraints**, and **non-functional requirements**. Here’s how to enhance it:

---

### **Key Additions for the Software Architect**  
#### **1. Technical Constraints & Assumptions**  
- Are there preferred languages/frameworks? (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django, Ruby/Rails)  
- Database choice: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB)?  
- Are there performance benchmarks? (e.g., response time < 500ms for 90% of requests)  
- Will the API follow REST standards strictly, or allow some flexibility (e.g., hybrid REST/GraphQL)?  

#### **2. Security & Compliance**  
- Should sensitive data (e.g., passwords) be encrypted at rest or in transit?  
- Are there logging/auditing requirements for security incidents?  
- How will API keys (if used) be managed and rotated?  
- Is rate limiting tiered by user role (e.g., stricter limits for guests)?  

#### **3. System Architecture**  
- Should the API be monolithic, microservices-based, or serverless?  
- Will the backend integrate with a specific frontend architecture (e.g., SSR vs. CSR implications)?  
- Are there requirements for horizontal scaling (e.g., load balancing, auto-scaling groups)?  

#### **4. Data Modeling & Relationships**  
- How are relationships between entities handled? (e.g., `User` ↔ `Post` ↔ `Comment`)  
- Should soft deletion be implemented (retain data with a `deleted_at` flag)?  
- Are database migrations or schema versioning tools required?  

#### **5. Error Handling & Logging**  
- What error response formats are needed? (e.g., standardized JSON error codes)  
- Should the API log errors to a third-party service (e.g., Sentry, Datadog)?  
- Are retry mechanisms needed for failed requests (e.g., idempotent operations)?  

#### **6. Integration with Frontend**  
- Will the React frontend require CORS configuration?  
- Are there plans for real-time features (e.g., WebSocket support for live comments)?  
- How will pagination/sorting parameters align with frontend needs?  

#### **7. Non-Functional Requirements**  
- **Scalability**: Expected concurrent users or requests?  
- **Availability**: Uptime SLAs (e.g., 99.9% uptime)?  
- **Maintainability**: Code quality standards, linting, or CI checks?  

#### **8. Deployment & Monitoring**  
- Environment setup: Staging vs. production configurations?  
- Monitoring: Tools for tracking API health (e.g., Prometheus, New Relic)?  
- Backup strategy: Frequency of database backups?  

---

### **Example Follow-Up Questions**  
1. **Performance**:  
   - Should frequently accessed data (e.g., trending posts) be cached?  
   - Are database read replicas needed for scaling reads?  

2. **Frontend-Backend Alignment**:  
   - Will the frontend need pre-signed URLs for media uploads (e.g., AWS S3 direct uploads)?  
   - Should the API support optimistic UI updates (e.g., like counts updated before server confirmation)?  

3. **Third-Party Dependencies**:  
   - Are there existing services to integrate (e.g., SendGrid for emails, Cloudinary for image processing)?  

---

### **Final Recommendation**  
The questionnaire is **sufficient to start**, but the Software Architect will likely ask for clarifications on:  
- **Trade-offs**: e.g., Consistency vs. availability in database design.  
- **Edge Cases**: How to handle race conditions (e.g., simultaneous post edits).  
- **Tooling**: Observability, testing frameworks, or API gateway usage.  

**Action Step**:  
1. Fill out the questionnaire with your answers.  
2. Share it alongside your **priorities** (e.g., “Speed over scalability for MVP”) and **assumptions** (e.g., “No real-time features in Phase 1”).  
3. Schedule a discussion to resolve ambiguities (e.g., authentication flow details).  

This ensures the architect can design a system that aligns with both your functional goals and technical realities.
