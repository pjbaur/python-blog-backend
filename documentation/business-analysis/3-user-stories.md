      - Rate limits are applied per user or IP.  
      - Limits reset after the specified time window.

35. **API CORS Support**  
    **As a developer, I want the API to support CORS so that I can build a secure frontend hosted on a different domain.**  
    - **Independent**: Separate from other API features.  
    - **Negotiable**: Allowed origins and CORS headers can be discussed.  
    - **Valuable**: Enables flexible frontend deployment.  
    - **Estimable**: Involves configuring CORS headers.  
    - **Small**: Focused on CORS implementation.  
    - **Testable**:  
      - Given I make a cross-origin request from an allowed domain, when the request is made, then the API responds with appropriate CORS headers (e.g., Access-Control-Allow-Origin).  
      - Requests from unallowed domains are rejected.  
      - OPTIONS preflight requests are handled correctly.

36. **API Key Authentication**  
    **As a developer, I want the API to support API key authentication so that I can secure automated requests.**  
    - **Independent**: Separate from user authentication.  
    - **Negotiable**: Key generation and validation process can be discussed.  
    - **Valuable**: Enables secure automation.  
    - **Estimable**: Involves API key generation and validation.  
    - **Small**: Focused on API key auth.  
    - **Testable**:  
      - Given I include a valid API key in the request header, when I call a protected endpoint, then the request succeeds.  
      - Requests without a valid key return a 401 status.  
      - API keys can be generated and revoked by authorized users.
