# System Architect questions

## My prompt
My project is going to be a REST API backend for a blog application. What should I ask the System Architect?

## For a blog application REST API, here are effective questions to ask the System Architect:

1. "As a System Architect, what would be the most appropriate architecture pattern for a blog API that needs to handle content creation, user comments, media uploads, and basic analytics?"

2. "As a System Architect, help me identify the core services/components needed for a scalable blog REST API, and how they should interact."

3. "As a System Architect, evaluate whether I should use a monolithic or microservice approach for a blog platform that expects moderate traffic but might need to scale in the future."

4. "As a System Architect, recommend a technology stack (programming language, framework, database) that would be well-suited for a blog API considering factors like development speed, maintainability, and performance."

5. "As a System Architect, outline how I should structure my blog API to easily accommodate future features like newsletter subscriptions, user notifications, and content recommendation."

6. "As a System Architect, provide guidance on how to implement efficient content caching strategies for my blog API to optimize performance for read-heavy operations."

7. "As a System Architect, design a high-level system diagram showing the main components of my blog API and their interactions with frontend clients and external services."

8. "As a System Architect, help me plan for content delivery optimization, especially for handling images and other media assets in my blog platform."

9. "As a System Architect, what search implementation would you recommend for my blog API to provide fast and relevant content discovery?"

10. "As a System Architect, outline an approach for implementing user authentication and authorization that balances security and user experience for my blog platform."

These questions will help you get valuable architectural insights specific to your blog application needs. Is there a particular aspect of the blog API architecture you'd like to explore further?
