# System Architect Questionnaire for Blog API Project
Created by Claude 3.7 Sonnet

## Project Fundamentals
1. What specific type of blog is this (personal, corporate, multi-author, news, etc.)?
2. Who are the primary content creators and consumers of the blog?
3. What makes this blog platform different from existing solutions?
4. Are there any unique features that would set this blog apart from others?
5. Will this be a standalone blog API or part of a larger platform?

## Content & Data Requirements
6. What types of content will the blog support (text, images, videos, podcasts, etc.)?
7. How complex are the content formatting requirements (rich text, markdown, HTML, etc.)?
8. Will the blog support drafts, scheduled publishing, or versioning of content?
9. What metadata needs to be associated with blog posts (tags, categories, author info, etc.)?
10. Will there be a need for content relationships (series, related posts, etc.)?

## User & Interaction Features
11. What user roles will exist (readers, authors, editors, admins)?
12. Will the blog support comments or other user interactions?
13. Is there a need for user profiles or author pages?
14. Will the blog require subscription or membership features?
15. Will social sharing or social media integration be needed?

## Scale & Performance
16. What is the expected post volume (posts per day/week)?
17. What is the expected reader traffic (views per day)?
18. Are there traffic spikes anticipated (viral content, seasonal patterns)?
19. How important is page load speed for the blog content?
20. Will the blog need to support global audiences?

## Integration & Extension
21. What frontend technologies will consume this API?
22. Will the blog need integration with email for notifications or newsletters?
23. Are there any analytics requirements beyond basic page views?
24. Will the blog need to integrate with social media platforms?
25. Is there a need for search engine optimization features?

27. Will the blog need full-text search capabilities?
28. Are there requirements for content recommendation features?
29. How will the blog handle archives and historical content?
30. Will the blog support tagging, categories, or other taxonomy systems?

## Security & Compliance
31. What authentication system will be used (OAuth, JWT, custom)?
32. Are there specific content moderation requirements?
33. What personal data will be collected from users?
34. Are there geographic data storage requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)?
35. Will the blog need to support content access controls or paywalls?

## Performance & Operations
36. How frequently will content be updated?
37. Will the blog need CDN integration for media content?
38. What are the image/media processing requirements?
39. Are there specific caching requirements for frequently accessed content?
40. What analytics and monitoring will be needed for the API?

## Future Considerations
41. Do you plan to monetize the blog (ads, subscriptions, etc.)?
42. What additional features might be added in the next 6-12 months?
43. Do you anticipate significant growth in users or content volume?
44. Will the blog eventually need to support multiple languages?
45. Are there plans to build mobile apps that will consume this API?


I've tailored the questionnaire specifically for your blog API project, focusing on the unique considerations for content management, user interactions, and blog-specific features.

Key additions for your blog API include:

1. **Content & Data Requirements** - Covers blog-specific content types, formatting options, and metadata needs
2. **User & Interaction Features** - Addresses commenting, user roles, and social engagement
3. **Content Discovery & Navigation** - Focuses on search, categorization, and content organization
4. **Performance considerations** - Tailored to blog traffic patterns and content delivery needs

This questionnaire will help you think through important architectural decisions like:
- How to structure your content storage
- Which authentication and authorization approach to use
- What caching strategies will be most effective
- How to design for content relationships and discovery
- Which backend services you'll need beyond the core API

You can use this as a starting point with stakeholders to ensure your blog API architecture addresses both current needs and future growth possibilities.

Is there a specific section you'd like to explore in more depth for your blog API project?

Thank you for providing your answers to the questionnaire. Based on your responses, I'd like to ask a few targeted follow-up questions to help me craft comprehensive architecture documents for your blog API project.

### Additional Questions:

1. **Technology preferences**: Do you have any specific preferences or constraints regarding:
   - Programming language/framework for the API (Node.js, Python/Django, Java Spring, etc.)?
   - Database technology (SQL vs NoSQL, and any specific database system)?

2. **Image handling**: You mentioned supporting images in posts. How do you envision storing these images? (Cloud storage like S3, database BLOBs, local file system, etc.)

3. **Authentication details**: 
   - Will you use social login options or just email/password authentication?
   - Do you plan to implement role-based access control (RBAC) or a simpler permission system?

4. **Deployment environment**:
   - Where do you plan to host this application? (Cloud provider, self-hosted, etc.)
   - Do you have any specific deployment strategy in mind? (Docker containers, serverless, etc.)

5. **API design preferences**:
   - Do you prefer a specific API style (REST, GraphQL, or hybrid)?
   - Any specific requirements for request/response formats (JSON, XML, etc.)?

6. **Search implementation**:
   - For full-text search, are you open to using specialized search services (Elasticsearch, etc.) or would you prefer database-native search?

7. **Monitoring and observability**:
   - What level of logging and monitoring do you want to implement initially?
   - Any specific metrics you're interested in tracking?

8. **Mobile considerations**:
   - For the planned mobile apps, will they need any specific API endpoints or functionality beyond what the web clients would use?

These additional details will help me create architecture documents that are better aligned with your specific needs and constraints.

## Here are the answers:

Technology preferences: Do you have any specific preferences or constraints regarding:
Programming language/framework for the API (Node.js, Python/Django, Java Spring, etc.)?
Database technology (SQL vs NoSQL, and any specific database system)? Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL

Image handling: You mentioned supporting images in posts. How do you envision storing these images? (Cloud storage like S3, database BLOBs, local file system, etc.) I have a local S3-clone I'll use. Later we can configure to use AWS S3.

Authentication details: 
Will you use social login options or just email/password authentication? We'll add social login options in a later release.
Do you plan to implement role-based access control (RBAC) or a simpler permission system? RBAC: ADMIN, AUTHOR. There will, as mentioned, be anonymous users - not sure if that needs a role, I'll let the implementation sort that out.

Deployment environment:
Where do you plan to host this application? (Cloud provider, self-hosted, etc.) Self hosted, I want to use Docker.
Do you have any specific deployment strategy in mind? (Docker containers, serverless, etc.) Docker. We can implement serverless in a later release.

API design preferences:
Do you prefer a specific API style (REST, GraphQL, or hybrid)? REST.
Any specific requirements for request/response formats (JSON, XML, etc.)? JSON. Since this is a REST API using JWT, I don't want to use form-based login, it should use JSON. JSON, JSON, JSON.

Search implementation:
For full-text search, are you open to using specialized search services (Elasticsearch, etc.) or would you prefer database-native search? Database-native if it's not complex, otherwise we can integrate Elasticsearch, but that would be in a later release.

Monitoring and observability:
What level of logging and monitoring do you want to implement initially? Standard logging. I do want to log web requests so we can track/analyze traffic.
Any specific metrics you're interested in tracking? Standard web analytics (agent, OS, IP, etc)

Mobile considerations:
For the planned mobile apps, will they need any specific API endpoints or functionality beyond what the web clients would use? Don't know -- we'll implement in a later release.
