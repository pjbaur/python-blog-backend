# Answers to the System Architect Questionnaire for Blog API Project

## Project Fundamentals
1. What specific type of blog is this (personal, corporate, multi-author, news, etc.)? Multi-author blog used as a personal project to showcase my development skills.
2. Who are the primary content creators and consumers of the blog? General users. There will be anonymous read-only access.
3. What makes this blog platform different from existing solutions? I don't seek to differentiate this application.
4. Are there any unique features that would set this blog apart from others? No.
5. Will this be a standalone blog API or part of a larger platform? Standalone API.

## Content & Data Requirements
6. What types of content will the blog support (text, images, videos, podcasts, etc.)? Text and images.
7. How complex are the content formatting requirements (rich text, markdown, HTML, etc.)? Plain text.
8. Will the blog support drafts, scheduled publishing, or versioning of content? Not initially. Drafts, scheduled publishing, and versioning could be introduced in later releases.
9. What metadata needs to be associated with blog posts (tags, categories, author info, etc.)? hashtags (10 max per post), categories (dynamic - you can add categories while you're creating a post), author info
10. Will there be a need for content relationships (series, related posts, etc.)? There will be a threaded comment system. In a later release we can introduce Series.

## User & Interaction Features
11. What user roles will exist (readers, authors, editors, admins)? Authors can create and edit their own posts. Anonymous users can read posts and comments. Authenticated users can edit their own content. Admins can edit anything, manage users, and delete posts (deleting a post also deletes the comment thread)

28. Are there requirements for content recommendation features? No.
29. How will the blog handle archives and historical content? TBD for a later release.
30. Will the blog support tagging, categories, or other taxonomy systems? Hashtags in the post body, a max of 10 per post. Categories as previously noted.

## Security & Compliance
31. What authentication system will be used (OAuth, JWT, custom)? JWT with token expiration. Use logout functionality, so we'll need token invalidation. Store tokens in a DB, periodically purge expired tokens.
32. Are there specific content moderation requirements? No.
33. What personal data will be collected from users? Nothing.
34. Are there geographic data storage requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)? No.
35. Will the blog need to support content access controls or paywalls? No.

## Performance & Operations
36. How frequently will content be updated? Infrequently (~10 edits per day)
37. Will the blog need CDN integration for media content? No.
38. What are the image/media processing requirements? None.
39. Are there specific caching requirements for frequently accessed content? TBD in a later release.
40. What analytics and monitoring will be needed for the API? TBD.

## Future Considerations
41. Do you plan to monetize the blog (ads, subscriptions, etc.)? No.
42. What additional features might be added in the next 6-12 months? Drafts, scheduled publishing, and versioning could be introduced in later releases. In a later release we can introduce Series, connecting a series of Posts. Archiving. Caching frequently accessed content. Analytics and monitoring.
43. Do you anticipate significant growth in users or content volume? No.
44. Will the blog eventually need to support multiple languages? No.
45. Are there plans to build mobile apps that will consume this API? Yes.

Thank you for providing your answers to the questionnaire. Based on your responses, I'd like to ask a few targeted follow-up questions to help me craft comprehensive architecture documents for your blog API project.

### Additional Questions:

1. **Technology preferences**: Do you have any specific preferences or constraints regarding:
   - Programming language/framework for the API (Node.js, Python/Django, Java Spring, etc.)?
   - Database technology (SQL vs NoSQL, and any specific database system)?

2. **Image handling**: You mentioned supporting images in posts. How do you envision storing these images? (Cloud storage like S3, database BLOBs, local file system, etc.)

3. **Authentication details**: 
   - Will you use social login options or just email/password authentication?
   - Do you plan to implement role-based access control (RBAC) or a simpler permission system?

4. **Deployment environment**:
   - Where do you plan to host this application? (Cloud provider, self-hosted, etc.)
   - Do you have any specific deployment strategy in mind? (Docker containers, serverless, etc.)

5. **API design preferences**:
   - Do you prefer a specific API style (REST, GraphQL, or hybrid)?
   - Any specific requirements for request/response formats (JSON, XML, etc.)?

6. **Search implementation**:
   - For full-text search, are you open to using specialized search services (Elasticsearch, etc.) or would you prefer database-native search?

7. **Monitoring and observability**:
   - What level of logging and monitoring do you want to implement initially?
   - Any specific metrics you're interested in tracking?

8. **Mobile considerations**:
   - For the planned mobile apps, will they need any specific API endpoints or functionality beyond what the web clients would use?

These additional details will help me create architecture documents that are better aligned with your specific needs and constraints.

Thank you for providing your answers to the questionnaire. Based on your responses, I'd like to ask a few targeted follow-up questions to help me craft comprehensive architecture documents for your blog API project.

### Additional Questions:

1. **Technology preferences**: Do you have any specific preferences or constraints regarding:
   - Programming language/framework for the API (Node.js, Python/Django, Java Spring, etc.)?
   - Database technology (SQL vs NoSQL, and any specific database system)? Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL

2. **Image handling**: You mentioned supporting images in posts. How do you envision storing these images? (Cloud storage like S3, database BLOBs, local file system, etc.) I have a local S3-clone I'll use. Later we can configure to use AWS S3.

3. **Authentication details**: 
   - Will you use social login options or just email/password authentication? We'll add social login options in a later release.
   - Do you plan to implement role-based access control (RBAC) or a simpler permission system? RBAC: ADMIN, AUTHOR. There will, as mentioned, be anonymous users - not sure if that needs a role, I'll let the implementation sort that out.

4. **Deployment environment**:
   - Where do you plan to host this application? (Cloud provider, self-hosted, etc.) Self hosted, I want to use Docker.
   - Do you have any specific deployment strategy in mind? (Docker containers, serverless, etc.) Docker. We can implement serverless in a later release.

5. **API design preferences**:
   - Do you prefer a specific API style (REST, GraphQL, or hybrid)? REST.
   - Any specific requirements for request/response formats (JSON, XML, etc.)? JSON. Since this is a REST API using JWT, I don't want to use form-based login, it should use JSON. JSON, JSON, JSON.

6. **Search implementation**:
   - For full-text search, are you open to using specialized search services (Elasticsearch, etc.) or would you prefer database-native search? Database-native if it's not complex, otherwise we can integrate Elasticsearch, but that would be in a later release.

7. **Monitoring and observability**:
   - What level of logging and monitoring do you want to implement initially? Standard logging. I do want to log web requests so we can track/analyze traffic.
   - Any specific metrics you're interested in tracking? Standard web analytics (agent, OS, IP, etc)

8. **Mobile considerations**:
   - For the planned mobile apps, will they need any specific API endpoints or functionality beyond what the web clients would use? Don't know -- we'll implement in a later release.

These additional details will help me create architecture documents that are better aligned with your specific needs and constraints.
