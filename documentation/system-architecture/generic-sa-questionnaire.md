# System Architect Initial Project Questionnaire
Created by Claude 3.7 Sonnet

## Project Fundamentals
1. What is the primary purpose of this system/application?
2. Who are the intended users/audience?
3. What specific business problem or opportunity does this project address?
4. What are the critical success factors for this project?
5. Are there any existing systems this will replace or integrate with?

## Requirements & Constraints
6. What are the core functional requirements (key features/capabilities)?
7. What are the primary non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, etc.)?
8. Are there any regulatory or compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, etc.)?
9. What are the time constraints or deadlines for the project?
10. What are the budget constraints or resource limitations?

## Scale & Performance
11. What is the expected user load (concurrent users, requests per second)?
12. What is the expected data volume (storage needs, growth rate)?
13. Are there any specific performance expectations or SLAs?
14. What are the availability and reliability requirements?
15. Are there any geographic distribution requirements for users or data?

## Technical Context
16. Is there an existing technology stack that needs to be used or integrated with?
17. Are there organizational preferences or standards for technologies?
18. What existing systems will this need to interface with?
19. Are there any specific API requirements or protocols that must be supported?
20. What authentication/authorization systems need to be integrated?

## Operational Considerations
21. What is the expected deployment environment (cloud provider, on-premises, hybrid)?
22. What are the backup and disaster recovery requirements?
23. What monitoring and observability needs exist?
24. What is the expected release frequency and deployment strategy?
25. Who will maintain the system after initial development?

## Future Planning
26. What is the anticipated growth trajectory for the next 1-3 years?
27. Are there planned features or capabilities for future phases?
28. How important is extensibility versus immediate delivery?
29. Are there any emerging technologies or trends that should be considered?
30. What parts of the system are most likely to change over time?


I've created a comprehensive questionnaire that a System Architect would typically use to gather essential information before diving into specific architectural decisions for your project. 

This questionnaire covers six key areas:
- Project fundamentals
- Requirements and constraints
- Scale and performance expectations
- Technical context
- Operational considerations
- Future planning

For your blog API project specifically, I'd recommend focusing on:
- Questions about expected traffic patterns (read-heavy vs. write-heavy)
- Integration requirements with frontend technologies
- Content storage and delivery considerations
- Authentication and user management needs
- Future growth plans for additional features

Would you like me to tailor this questionnaire further for your blog API project, or would you prefer guidance on how to use these questions to develop your architectural approach?
