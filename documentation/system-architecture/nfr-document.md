- Search operations should return results in under 500ms
- Image upload/download operations should complete within 2 seconds

### 1.2 Throughput
- The system should handle at least 10 concurrent users without degradation
- The API should be able to process at least 10 requests per second

### 1.3 Resource Utilization
- The application should operate within 1GB of RAM in production
- Database size should remain under 10GB for the first year of operation

## 2. Security

### 2.1 Authentication & Authorization
- All authenticated API endpoints must require valid JWT tokens
- JWT tokens must expire after 30 minutes
- Refresh tokens must expire after 7 days
- Password storage must use bcrypt with appropriate work factor
- Invalid login attempts should be rate-limited

### 2.2 Data Protection
- All API communication must be over HTTPS
- Sensitive user data (passwords) must never be returned in API responses
- JWT tokens must be invalidated on logout

### 2.3 Input Validation
- All API inputs must be validated and sanitized
- The API should be protected against common attacks (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)

## 3. Reliability

### 3.1 Availability
- The system should have 99% uptime during development
- Scheduled maintenance should be performed during low-usage periods

### 3.2 Fault Tolerance
- The system should gracefully handle database connection issues
- Failed image uploads should not prevent post creation/updates

### 3.3 Data Integrity
- Database transactions should be used to ensure data consistency
- Regular automated backups should be configured

## 4. Scalability

### 4.1 Horizontal Scalability
- The application architecture should allow for future containerization and scaling
- Database design should support future sharding if needed

### 4.2 Vertical Scalability
- The application should be able to utilize additional resources when allocated

## 5. Maintainability

### 5.1 Code Quality
- Code should follow PEP 8 standards for Python
- Comprehensive unit tests should cover core functionality
- Integration tests should verify API behavior

### 5.2 Documentation
- API endpoints should be documented with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Database schema should be documented
- Setup and deployment procedures should be documented

## 6. Monitoring & Logging

### 6.1 Logging
- All API requests should be logged with timestamp, endpoint, user agent, and response time
- Authentication events should be logged
- Error conditions should be logged with appropriate detail

### 6.2 Monitoring
- Basic health checks should be implemented
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk) should be monitored

## 7. Compatibility

### 7.1 Client Compatibility
- The API should support modern browsers via the React and Angular frontends
- The API should be designed to support future mobile applications

### 7.2 Integration
- The API should follow standard REST conventions
- All data should be exchanged in JSON format

## 8. Compliance & Privacy

### 8.1 Data Handling
- The application should collect minimal personal data
- User data should be easily exportable and deletable if requested

## 9. Deployment & DevOps

### 9.1 Containerization
