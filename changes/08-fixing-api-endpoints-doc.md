The api-endpoints.md file is thorough and well-structured, but it is not fully complete or perfectly accurate with respect to the current implementation and best practices. Here are the key points:

**Strengths:**
- It covers all major endpoint groups: Authentication, Users, Posts, Comments, Categories, Search, Hashtags.
- It documents HTTP methods, request/response bodies, and required authentication for most endpoints.
- Query parameters for filtering, sorting, and pagination are mentioned where relevant.

**Issues and Gaps:**
1. **FIXED** **Duplicate Fields:** There are copy-paste errors in request/response bodies (e.g., `"email": string` appears twice in some places).
2. **FIXED** **Missing Endpoints:** The documentation omits some endpoints present in the code and README, such as:
   - POST /api/v1/comments/{comment_id}/replies (for threaded replies)
     [X] Is this in README.md?
     [X] Is this in app/routers/comments.py?
     [X] Is this in app/tests/test_comments.py?
     [X] Is this in documentation/api-design/api-endpoints.md
   - POST /api/v1/auth/change-password (for password changes)
     [X] Where is this coded?
     [X] Is this in README.md?
     [X] Is this tested?
     [X] Is this in documentation/api-design/api-endpoints.md
   - GET /api/v1/admin/users (admin-only user listing)
     [X] Where is this coded? app/routers/admin.py
     [X] Is this in README.md?
     [X] Is this tested?
     [X] Is this in documentation/api-design/api-endpoints.md
3. **FIXED** **Inconsistent Field Names:** Some endpoints use `"content"` for comments, while others use `"body"`. The implementation and OpenAPI specs often use `"body"`. **All comment endpoints and documentation should use `"body"` as the field name for comment text.**
4. **Error Handling:** There is no section describing error response formats, status codes, or error handling conventions.
5. **Role/Permission Details:** While some endpoints mention required roles, the documentation could be clearer about which endpoints require authentication or admin privileges.
6. **Envelope and Metadata:** The structure for pagination metadata and response envelopes is not fully described.
7. **Future/Planned Features:** Features like HATEOAS, rate limiting, and advanced filtering are not mentioned as planned or out of scope.
8. **Consistency with OpenAPI:** The OpenAPI/Swagger spec (in all-documents-chatgpt.md and all-documents-deepseek.md) is more detailed and should be referenced or linked.

**Conclusion:**  
The file is a strong starting point but needs corrections and additions to be fully accurate and comprehensive. It should be updated to:
- Fix field duplication and naming inconsistencies.
- Add missing endpoints and clarify authentication/authorization requirements.
- Document error responses and pagination metadata.
- Reference or align with the OpenAPI spec for full accuracy.
