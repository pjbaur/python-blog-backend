Based on your confirmation, I'll provide detailed guidance on implementing the recommended schema naming convention for your Python blog backend project.

## Schema Naming Convention Implementation Guide

The recommended **Entity + Action + Type** pattern (`{Entity}{Action}{Type}`) will help standardize your schemas across the application. Here's a comprehensive implementation plan that respects your current code structure while improving consistency.

### Step 1: Standardize Request Schemas

For input/creation schemas, use the `{Entity}CreateRequest` pattern:
- Rename `UserCreate` to `UserCreateRequest`
- Rename `PostCreate` to `PostCreateRequest`
- Rename `CommentCreate` to `CommentCreateRequest`

### Step 2: Standardize Response Schemas

Your response schemas already follow a good pattern with `{Entity}Response`, so these can remain as they are:
- `UserResponse`
- `PostResponse`
- `CommentResponse`
- `ImageResponse`

### Step 3: Keep Authentication-specific Naming

Authentication schemas that represent actions rather than entities should maintain their action-first naming:
- `LoginRequest`
- `LogoutRequest`
- `RefreshTokenRequest`

### Step 4: Update Entity Models

For the token-related schemas:
- Rename `Token` to `TokenResponse`
- Keep `TokenInfo` as is since it represents a data model rather than a request/response

### Step 5: Documentation Updates

You should update any documentation that references the schema names, including:
- API documentation
- Test files
- Comments within code

### Implementation Process

When implementing this convention, I recommend the following process:

1. Create a mapping document listing all current schemas and their new names
2. Update schema definitions one file at a time
3. Use IDE search/replace features to update all references
4. Run tests after each file update to catch any issues early
5. Update API documentation to reflect the new naming

### Impact Analysis

Implementing this convention will affect:
- schemas.py (primary source)
- `app/routers/*.py` files (references to schemas)
- crud.py (potential references)
- `app/tests/*.py` (test files using schemas)

### Example Mapping Document

```
Original Schema Name    | New Schema Name
------------------------|------------------------
UserBase                | UserBase (unchanged)
UserCreate              | UserCreateRequest
UserUpdate              | UserUpdateRequest
UserResponse            | UserResponse (unchanged)
UserPublicResponse      | UserPublicResponse (unchanged)
LoginRequest            | LoginRequest (unchanged)
Token                   | TokenResponse
RefreshTokenRequest     | RefreshTokenRequest (unchanged)
LogoutRequest           | LogoutRequest (unchanged)
PostCreate              | PostCreateRequest
PostResponse            | PostResponse (unchanged)
PostUpdateRequest       | PostUpdateRequest (unchanged)
CommentCreate           | CommentCreateRequest
CommentResponse         | CommentResponse (unchanged)
CommentUpdateRequest    | CommentUpdateRequest (unchanged)
ImageResponse           | ImageResponse (unchanged)
```

### Benefits of this Implementation

1. **Improved Code Readability**: The purpose of each schema becomes immediately clear
2. **Consistent API Documentation**: Makes your API documentation more intuitive
3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: New developers will more easily understand the codebase
4. **Better IDE Support**: Autocomplete and search functions work more predictably

This convention aligns with FastAPI best practices and will establish a foundation for consistent naming as your application grows and evolves.
