Here is a detailed plan for implementing a comments feature in your Python blog backend, taking into account your current architecture and the documentation in the documentation/ folder:

1. Requirements & Analysis
- Review `3-user-stories.md` and `1-answers.md` for user needs regarding comments (e.g., who can comment, moderation, threading).
- Check `api-endpoints.md` for any existing or planned comment-related endpoints.
- Consult `database-schema.mermaid` for how comments might fit into your data model.

2. Data Model Design
- Extend `models.py` to add a CommentModel with fields such as id, post_id, author_id, body, created_at, updated_at, parent_comment_id (for threading), is_approved, is_deleted.
- Update `database-schema.mermaid` to reflect the new comments collection/table and its relationships.

3. Schemas
- Add Pydantic schemas in `app/schemas.py`: CommentCreate, CommentResponse, CommentUpdate.
- Ensure response models are consistent with your API design documentation.

4. CRUD Operations
- Implement comment CRUD functions in `app/crud.py`: create_comment, get_comment_by_id, get_comments_for_post, update_comment, delete_comment, moderate_comment.
- Consider soft deletion and moderation status.

5. API Endpoints
- Create a new `app/routers/comments.py`.
- Add endpoints:
  - POST /api/v1/posts/{post_id}/comments (create comment)
  - GET /api/v1/posts/{post_id}/comments (list comments for a post)
  - GET /api/v1/comments/{comment_id} (get single comment)
  - PUT /api/v1/comments/{comment_id} (edit comment, with permission checks)
  - DELETE /api/v1/comments/{comment_id} (delete comment, with permission checks)
  - (Optional) POST /api/v1/comments/{comment_id}/moderate (admin/moderator action)
- Register the new router in `app/routes.py`.

6. Permissions & Moderation
- Define who can create, edit, delete, and moderate comments (users, admins, moderators).
- Add permission checks in the endpoints, leveraging your existing auth and user role system.
- Consider adding a moderation queue for unapproved or reported comments.

7. Testing
- Add tests in `app/tests/test_comments.py` for all endpoints and edge cases (permissions, threading, moderation).
- Update or add test utilities as needed.

8. Documentation
- Update `api-endpoints.md` with the new endpoints.
- Add usage examples and permission notes.
- Update `database-schema.mermaid` and `architectural-artifacts.md` to include comments.

9. Logging & Auditing
- Add logging for comment actions in `app/logger.py`.
- Consider audit trails for moderation actions.

10. Future Enhancements (for backlog)
- Support for comment notifications (email, in-app).
- Rate limiting and spam protection.
- Advanced moderation (auto-moderation, reporting, etc.).
- UI/UX for threaded comments if a frontend is planned.

This plan ensures the comments feature is robust, maintainable, and well-documented, fitting into your existing backend structure and aligning with your documentation standards.
